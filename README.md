Command-line wordle clone in Rust.

## Building this project

Install Rust programming language using official installer, [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

If using Visual Studio Code, install the
[rust-analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer),
and uninstall the [official Rust one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) if you have it.
Rust-analyzer is better and active and it's being phased in to replace the other.

Rust's command-line tool, cargo, manages the build.
The command `cargo test` will run tests (and initialize commit hooks),
`cargo run` will run the binary,
and `cargo doc --open` will open documentation,
See: [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html),
"[Build Commands](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/build-commands.html)."

See also [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy),
a linter which is used in the
[continuous integration](https://github.com/jackwillis/wordle/actions/workflows/build.yml).
